# Taylor-Series-and-Approximation
This project is a immensly juvenile attempt to mode the behaviour of Taylor Series Approximation . Using Python , this project aims at finding the number of terms required in the approximation(N) to have an error of less than or equal to 5% in modelling different functions . It also aims at investigating the variation in N for different functions and plot the same . Since , initially it seems that the behaviour of most of the common functions will depend on the value of e , it aims at alter the values of e and investigate the above resulting in a three-dimentional analysis with the variables being e,N,%error.

Apparently , following modules can be used for achieveing the desired operation 
  - Derivatives and other mathematical operations : Sympy and math 
  - Plotting - Seaborn and matplotlib
